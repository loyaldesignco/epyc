Over the course of 1946, 150,000 Jews are repatriated to Poland from the Soviet Union. The Brichah (meaning, \"escape\") organization assists many Jews in their \"flight\" from Poland, many following the Kielce pogrom of July 1946. By 1947, approximately 250,000 Jewish Displaced Persons are concentrated in the assembly centers of Germany and Austria. The fate of the Jewish DPs ends up playing a central role in diplomatic negotiations leading to the creation of the State of Israel, and approximately two-thirds of the DPs migrate there after 1948.",
